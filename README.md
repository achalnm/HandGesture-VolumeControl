# ðŸ“ˆ Volume Control with Hand Gestures

Welcome to the **Volume Control with Hand Gestures** project! This innovative project leverages machine learning and computer vision to control your PC's volume using simple hand gestures. With this solution, you can adjust the volume by simply giving a thumbs up or thumbs down.

## ðŸŒŸ Features

- **Gesture Recognition:** Detects thumbs up and thumbs down gestures to control volume.
- **Real-Time Processing:** Processes webcam feed in real-time to adjust volume.
- **Machine Learning Model:** Utilizes a deep learning model trained on labeled image data.
- **Seamless Integration:** Works directly with your PC's volume controls.

## ðŸ’» Technologies Used

- **Python**: The core programming language for the project.
- **Flask**: For creating a simple web interface for file uploads.
- **TensorFlow**: Used to build and train the deep learning model.
- **OpenCV**: Handles real-time image processing.
- **scikit-learn**: For splitting data into training and testing sets.
- **PyCaw**: Manages audio volume control on Windows.
